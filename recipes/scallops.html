    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this simple scallop recipe, large sea scallops are sautéed in butter and garlic and served with a lemon-butter sauce. They will melt in your mouth!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: Start by melting a stick and a half of butter in a skillet. </li>
        <li>Garlic: Fresh minced garlic cooked in butter creates a bold flavor base. </li>
        <li>Scallops: Of course, you’ll need scallops! Two pounds of fresh scallops should make about six servings.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice: Fresh lemon juice adds welcome brightness.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt and pepper enhance the overall flavor of the scallops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in garlic and cook for a few seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Arrange scallops in a single layer in the skillet; cook until golden brown on one side, about 2 minutes. Turn scallops over using tongs and continue cooking until firm and opaque, about 2 minutes more. Transfer scallops to a platter, reserving butter in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Whisk lemon juice, salt, and pepper into butter; pour sauce over scallops to serve.</li>
    </ol>
